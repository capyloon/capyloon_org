        We believe that a better Web is possible, for the benefit of all: users,
        content creators, service developers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="capyloon">Capyloon</span> is an experimental user agent
        that aims to give you what you deserve: freedom from the constraints
        imposed by a handful of OS vendors and service providers who decide what
        you can or can't do online, and how.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern mobile OSes like to present themselves as paragons of user
        friendliness and power. That can't be less true however: for instance,
        why can't you easily know what song was playing at a given point of a
        cycling route once home? Of course you can't expect applications to all
        know about each other - but the current OSes are failing to bridge that
        gap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both for business reasons and because of their dated design, the
        incumbents mobile OSes favor silos bundling applications code with their
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, you should to be able to make the most of the data you create
        and consume when using these services, on your own terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately we have solid foundations to build on: the Web as an
        application platform offers unique strengths to remedy to these
        problems. A web runtime has unrivaled capabilitoes to leverage your
        online activity for your benefit. That's why
        <span class="capyloon">Capyloon</span> is built as a Web based OS,
        re-using and extending <a href="https://github.com/b2gOS">b2gOS</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's still early days and we don't have all the answers, so it's
        important to keep an open mind and to experiment with new ideas. The
        current prototype starts to explore some: support for the IPFS protocol
        and for privacy respecting Web Assembly plugins to bring code to your
        data instead of the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can these technologies (and others!) fit together to provide user
        control alongside the creation of an ecosystem for creators of content
        and plugins? What kind of payment system can fit in? What are the UX
        challenges?
