    <h3>Why?</h3>

    <p class="better-web">
      We believe a better Web is possible, for the benefit of all: users,
      content creators, service developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern mobile OSes like to present themselves as paragons of user
      friendliness and power. That can't be less true however: for instance, why
      can't I easily figure out what song was playing from a music service at a
      given point of a cycling route once home? Of course none of these apps can
      integrate with all the others - but the current OSes are not able to
      bridge the gap either.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incumbents mobile OSes favor silos bundling apps with their data for technical
      and business reasons.
      Instead, you should to be able to make the most of the data you create and
      consume when using these services, on your own terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="capyloon">Capyloon</span> is an experimental user agent that
      aims to give you what you deserve: being freed from the constraints
      imposed by a handful of OS vendors and service providers who decide what
      you can or can't do online, and how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, the Web as an application platform offers unique strengths to
      remedy to these problems. A web runtime has unrivaled capability to
      leverage your online activity for your benefit. That's why
      <span class="capyloon">Capyloon</span> is built as a Web based OS,
      re-using and extending <a href="https://github.com/b2gOS">b2gOS</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it's still early days and we don't have all the answers,
      it's important to keep an open mind and to experiment with new ideas.
      For instance, the current prototype includes early support for the IPFS
      protocol and for privacy respecting Web Assembly plugins. Can these
      technologies fit together to provide user control alongside the creation
      of an ecosystem for creators of content and plugins? What kind of payment
      system can fit in? What are the UX challenges?
