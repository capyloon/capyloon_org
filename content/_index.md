Portable electronics don't have to be a blackbox. Imagine an OS where you understood everything. From how things were drawn, to how things are processed. 

The web, the internet, is that kind of open platform.

Capyloon is a web-first mobile operating system that takes lovable web technologies to embedded hardware. Security is top of mind. It's fun to build on. And you can target it for a lot more than just phones.

Seriously, check out the UI code, it's just [HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/capyloon/nutria/tree/main/apps/homescreen). 

Now you’re probably thinking *why*?

#### Open
The web, and mostly everything built around it, is [open](https://www.w3.org/). It’s not owned by one company. It's not a proprietary technology. From accessbility, localization and security, a bunch of people talk through these things.

Capyloon is powered by Gecko (the thing that powers Firefox). And it's [open source](https://github.com/capyloon) too. Chip away.

#### Easy to Develop
You know how easy it is to build for the web? As easy as firing up your browser and editing some code. 

Capyloon is no different. Here's the code for the [lockscreen](https://github.com/capyloon/nutria/tree/main/apps/homescreen). Want to build experiences for AR glasses, a smartwatch, or even a doorbell, all it takes is some HTML/CSS. 

#### Experimental
Okay, this is us dreaming. But this is an operating system. Well also a browser. Hmm, actually, a rust program. When do you ever get the chance to tweak things from the UI all the way down to the hardware.

We have a great framework that gives us so much room to experiment. To really think how devices are connected. 


## Getting started

You can either use a physical device or the simulator to get started. And yes, Capyloon runs on actual devices.

Here it is running on [Pinephone](https://pine64.com/product/pinephone-pro-explorer-edition/) and [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/).

You can get up and running by reviewing the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart). Or jump straight into [packages](/packages) to download an image.

### Join Us

Do we have it all figured out? Absolutely not. So many things that can be made better.

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/capyloon).
